# I'm Sebastian, nice to meet you!
![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbmueller/sbmueller/master/readme_header.png)
I'm a **software engineer** for **autonomous driving** at [ZF Group](https://www.zf.com/) in Friedrichshafen.

By training, I have a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Techonology from
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/) 🎓. I did a lot of Software Defined
Radio during my master's 📡 and have a strong affection for the [GNU Radio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio) open-source project.

## My Interests
### Technologies
- 🛠 I'm passionate about **modern [C++](https://github.com/isocpp)** development
- 🐍 I love **[Python 3](https://github.com/python)** since you can write stunning applications in minutes, great for prototyping
- 🦀 I'm super excited about **[rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang)** and am learning it during some excersises at home
- ❌ I'm *not* a web dev or java dev!

### Environment
- 🐧 [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) ist the best OS for me to be productive
- ⌨️  [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) is my IDE of choice (who doesn't first compile their IDE before starting to code, huh?)
- 🌱 [Git](https://github.com/git/git), just git

### Culture
- 🎢 I like a startup like environment with low hierachies and efficient processes, where all
ideas are equally heard
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I am member of an **agile [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/)** team and don't want to miss it anymore
- 🏖 I am all for a healthy work-life-balance (no work on weekends, no permanent overtime)!
- 💯 Focus on [clean code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) and best practices
- 🛣 Favor paying down technical debt and improving daily work over feature development

### Personal
- 🚴 I'm a hobby triathlete and train almost every day on the bike, running, in the pool or lifting weights
- 🌿 Sustainability is a big concern to me
