# I'm Sebastian, nice to meet you!

![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbmueller/sbmueller/master/readme_header.png)

I'm a **software engineer** for **fundamental C++ libraries** at
[ZF Group](https://www.zf.com/) in Friedrichshafen.

By training, I have a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and Information
Techonology from [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/) 🎓.
I did a lot of Software Defined Radio during my master's 📡, but now have
shifted to contribute making autonomous vehicles become a reality 🤖.

## My Interests

### Technologies

- 🛠 I'm passionate about **modern [C++](https://github.com/isocpp)**
  development
- 🐍 I love **[Python 3](https://github.com/python)** since you can write
  stunning applications in minutes, great for prototyping
- 🦀 I'm super excited about **[rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang)** and
  pursue mastering it since I believe it will be an important future technology
- ❌ I'm _not_ a web dev or java dev!

### Environment

- 🐧 A [Unix](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) based OS is the best for me to
  be productive
- ⌨️ [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is my IDE of choice (who doesn't
  first compile their IDE before starting to code, huh?)
- 🌱 [Git](https://github.com/git/git), just git

### Culture

- 🎢 I like a startup like environment with low hierarchies and lean
  processes
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I am member of an **agile** software team
- 🏖 I am all for a healthy **work-life-balance** (no work on weekends, no
  permanent overtime)!
- 💯 Focus on [clean
  code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) and best
  practices
- 🛣 Favor paying down technical debt and improving daily work over feature
  development
- 🌍 I'm working 100% remotely and choose my location independent of my employer's
  offices

### Personal

- 🚴 I'm a hobby triathlete and train almost every day on the bike, running, in
  the pool or lifting weights
- 🌿 Sustainability is a big concern to me
